# DataCopy
A tool to copy specific records from one SGBD to another - with all related ancestors and descendants. 
Origin and Destination databases can be even different products from different vendors: from Microsoft SQL Server to Oracle, from Oracle do MariaDB and so on. Proper conversions will be made when possible, like convert Oracle's varchar2 to SQLServer varchar.

The WinApp should work as a full power app, so it can be used to plan (desing) de copy and also to execute it. It also can save the plans to a proprietary file format, which can be read later. In the future there will be other apps (windows forms, windows console and maybe other platforms) just to run the plans - it may be called "copy runners".
